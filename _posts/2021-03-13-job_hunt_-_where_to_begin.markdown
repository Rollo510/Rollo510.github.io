For my first blog entry post-graduation from Flatiron School, I want to keep it simple and recommend a few things to do first when beginning your job search.  Here's a list of my top 4 suggestions on what you should be prioritizing:

1.) Keep Studying! 
    
One of the worst things you can do is "rest on your laurels" and think that you're ready to enter the workforce as a newly-minted Software Engineer.  Honestly, graduating from a coding bootcamp is just the beginning; you've learned a lot of valuable skills and should have a portfolio of respectable projects under your belt, but none of those will get you a job by themselves.  As the saying goes, "use it or lose it," so make sure that you aren't forgetting languages that you might have used at the beginning of the bootcamp and strayed away from towards the end.  Keep coding, and make sure you don't put yourself in a position where you forget something easy because you haven't used it in months!

2.) Practice something new: Algorithms and Data Structures

If there's anything I've learned about interviews, it's that they will focus on technical challenges and questions that are microcosms unto themselves.  I highly doubt that a company is going to ask you to build a website from scratch.  Instead, they're much more likely to ask you to solve a problem, or code a function that accomplishes some kind of task.  Practice these! Go on Leetcode or Codewars and study questions that will require you to think of a unique way to solve the problem.  Similarly, data structures are another big part of any actual Software Engineering job, and will likely be asked about in an interview.  Make sure you understand lists and arrays, as well as Big O notation.

3.)  Network

I'm sure we've all heard the saying, "it's not what you know but who," and that certainly applies to the job search.  Think about it like this: one of the few ways that we can stand out to potential employers is by doing exactly that--making ourselves known to them.  In order to do so, we must connect with them, and there's no better way to do that than by actually reaching out, or by getting someone you know to vouch for you.  It's scary, I know, and it feels almost like groveling trying to get a hiring manager or recruiter to notice you, but keep it friendly, be polite, and it just might work.  There's really no harm in trying!

4.) Make sure you're actually ready to apply

Get your resume in order.  Draft a few mock cover letters.  Create a portfolio with all of your projects.  You will save yourself a lot of time if you make sure that you have everything in order before fulling committing to your job search.  Imagine this: you've just applied to 5 different companies, when you notice a glaring typo on your resume.  What do you do?  Should you resubmit your application?  These are small missteps that you don't want to negatively affect the hiring manager's opinion of you.  Make sure you have your application materials in order!


These 4 suggestions are just something to consider if you're starting off in your job search.  I would say that most important of all is to not lose hope.  You'll get rejected by companies.  You won't hear back from others.  It'll feel like you'll never find a job.  This is normal, and it happens to most people.  Don't be discouraged! Keep studying, practicing new material, networking, and fixing up your application materials and no one can say that you aren't trying.  Don't forget, there are tons of people just like us, and I'm not giving up and neither should you!
