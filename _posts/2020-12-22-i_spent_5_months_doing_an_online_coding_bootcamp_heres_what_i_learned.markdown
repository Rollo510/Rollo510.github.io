First of all, yes, the clickbait title was on purpose.  I guess maybe there actually is some science behind why every website nowadays has articles with these kinds of titles.  If you're interested in my thoughts on if you should join a coding bootcamp or not, well, it ends up being kind of like the title of this blog -- are you going to be able to stand out?   

I'm old enough to have grown up alongside the Internet in its early days, way back when it took a minute and a lot of screeching to connect to your 56k dial-up modem.  While all of my friends in high school had the foresight to get into Computer Science early, I instead chose to chug along aimlessly, later getting into a good Liberal Arts school and majoring in something that I really wasn't very interested in.  Looking back, I regret not getting into software engineering earlier because I always knew I'd be good at it.  Do you feel the same way?  If so, I'm here to level with you about what you should expect joining a coding bootcamp.

First, and perhaps obviously enough, software engineering is not for everyone.  This should go without saying, but I want to stress both sides here: if you *do* end up giving it a shot, there's nothing wrong with realizing that you aren't enjoying the work that you're putting in.  Work doesn't always have to be fun, but you shouldn't hate it either.  If you find yourself struggling and not understanding what's going on, but you still smile when you manage to get your application to work, keep at it.  There will come a point where things start to make more sense, and you'll be glad you stuck around.  My cohort began with somewhere close to 50 or 60 people; now, we're a graduating class of about 20.  Sometimes it's just not the right career.  Don't force it!

When I signed up for my bootcamp, I chose the "full-time" program because I wanted to get done as soon as possible so I could begin my new career.  This was not a mistake.  Full-time means you need to be devoting full-time hours each week to learning the material.  I'll let you in on the most important thing I've learned from my bootcamp: this isn't high school.  You shouldn't be doing the coursework and projects for the sake of having something to turn in.  You aren't just trying to get by.  You should be trying to excel.  The module projects that you do are a reflection of your skill in each of the major areas that your bootcamp teaches.  When you apply for a job and they look at your resume, the biggest thing that will make them take notice of you is your projects.  Remember, the coursework is trying to **teach you the material**.  It isn't some obstacle to overcome each week.  Put in the time to learn as much as you can so you can create applications that will stand out.  Pick a pace--whether it's full-time, part-time, or self-paced, that works for you. 

The last bit of advice that I have for you is something that you might not even need.  Prepare for the unexpected.  Things may--or may not!-- happen that are beyond your control or understanding.  My cohort lost *both* of our instructors, and they were both phenomenal.  Imagine getting to the final leg of the bootcamp race and then being expected to finish the last module self-paced.  Myself and a couple others have encountered minor technical issues with getting some labs to work correctly, and getting my computer set up initially was a Herculean feat.  Some of the labs taught outdated information, repeated lessons, or had confusing instructions that led to frustration.  You can't really prepare for these problems, but don't mistake them as being a sign that software engineering isn't for you.  If it's right, you'll find a way to make it work.  Don't get discouraged by minor setbacks!

Looking back, I know that I made the right choice.  There's stories of people teaching themselves multiple programming languages, creating some incredible application, and getting a job because of it.  That isn't me.  I'm a normal person with a passion for coding that I wouldn't have discovered if I hadn't taken the plunge and tried something new.   I would recommend first trying out some free coding websites to make sure you aren't face-checking a career that you absolutely don't mesh well with.  Remember, coding isn't for everyone, and there's nothing wrong with that.  I had to give up my dreams of being an astronaut as a kid when I realized that, wow, I really hate math.  Once you commit to your program, **actually** commit to it.  Put in the time, go to the effort, and really give it your best shot.  There's nothing stopping you from becoming a software engineer.
